The whole time we were browsing, she was following us around, not to help us but to keep a close watch on us. I believe she suspected we were going to steal the items. When we looked at her, she narrowed her eyes and glared at us. Her attitude at the checkout was also very unfriendly.

In other stores, wrapping the fragile items would be the bare minimum; however, this store does not seem to care about its customers whatsoever.

                "text": "This is a mesmerizing coffee trip that you will definitely come back to again and again.\n\nLet me start by saying that I actually hate coffee.\nNo matter whether it is low-priced or high-priced coffee, I always get palpitations or dizziness after drinking it. Some are even so bitter that I feel like they taste like cigarette ash.\n\nBut what I must share is that I drank the entire coffee set at this place and still felt unsatisfied!\n\nI like the elegant green tone of the entire store. The bar-style design allows guests to appreciate the eyes and techniques of the coffee staff who are focusing on carefully making coffee in front of them. Guests can also easily chat with every guest they meet by chance. I also like that it is obviously Coffee has ever-changing appearances, and I also like the unique snacks that go with each drink... Combining these preferences, I hope to recommend it to everyone to try.\n\nThis is already my second visit. It’s been just over a week since the last visit, and I’m already thinking about it! I think it’s an art-level drink that’s worth trying~\n\nCurrently all charges in the store are cash!",

Sorry to say this but service is quite poor and unprofessional for an Italian restaurant. At the beginning we ordered salmon and fig appetizer (it turned out to be a salad dish) and beef tartare, waitress recommended us to order salad and we followed her recommendation. It turned out we have too much green for appetizer. Then when we ordered the tenderloin, we asked if it’s beef or pork, the waitress answered “pork” while it is obviously beef when it was served… During the lunch time the restaurant is never full but it seemed HARD to get waitress’s attention to look after our needs. And it was the cook that reminds waitress to replace our dirty plates!!! There’s zero introduction when every dish is served as well… I’m sorry but this experience really makes us quite disappointed…",

The red prawn linguine, crafted with handmade pasta, boasted a sauce bursting with flavor, accentuating the richness of the prawns. It's undoubtedly the finest rendition of this dish we've sampled in the city. The lamb chops, coated in a pistachio crust, were a revelation, marrying the tang of mustard and vinegar with the inherent succulence of the meat. Each bite offered a delightful contrast of textures. Moreover, the generous portions offered excellent value, making this establishment stand out among its Italian counterparts.\n\nWhile the staff members are undoubtedly friendly, their casual demeanor sometimes extends to chatting and using their cell phones in the kitchen, which may affect the overall ambiance. Additionally, the lighting could be improved by dimming it slightly and incorporating warmer tones, as the current bright, yellow light doesn't quite create the desired atmosphere. The music, while lively, can at times be too loud, giving the impression of being in a bar rather than a dining establishment. Adjusting these elements could enhance the overall dining experience",

It’s not super comfortable but it’s acceptable.\n- The concept is innovative I guess? Never tasted such rice burgers but it’s not delicious .. just new… and it’s not inexpensive\n- It felt pretty industrial, especially the chicken nuggets : I didn’t like them…\n- the employees were very kind and helpful\n\nOverall good experience but would not come back, there  are a lot of better food spot options in taipei!",

Overall it’ll take you about 20 minutes to walk here from the Taipei 101 (or 15 minutes from the Xiangshan metro station). It’s fairly straightforward to find and the view is quite nice. Be prepared to wait your turn as there are usually several photographers here at any time (particularly just after dark). Be respectful of those posing for shots, but also of nearby restaurants (like the one with the two red lanterns on the right). There is usually foot traffic going up or down the alley as well as scooters and automobiles passing, so don’t stand in the road. The sidewalk has enough height to allow for a good framing of the Taipei 101. Good shots in the day, better at night, but be aware the Taipei 102 building turn off at 10pm; so plan your shots.",

It’s not like he didn’t pay👍🏻\n\nIt is recommended that you do not visit\nBecause this store may not be short of money and doesn’t want to do business\nThe drinks don’t taste very good either. Maybe it’s because of the bad attitude of the store staff that it affects the taste🤌🏿\n\nIf you don’t want to open a store, I suggest you take the store back home and take a good rest ^_^ Every day is a typhoon holiday🎶🎵🎸🥁",

Ponyo was admitted to the hospital due to an incorrect diagnosis of infection after surgery in another hospital. Dr. Li initially took over the care. Dr. Huang was busy because he was originally suspected of having a heart problem. I helped scan the heart and did an ultrasound to confirm that there was no heart condition, and then Director Lin helped clean the wound in a full clinic.\nThe entire process was done professionally and with appropriate care.\nDuring my hospitalization, I also saw that my condition was getting better and better every day.\nThanks to the three doctors for their help, Ponyo got through this difficult time.\nGuangdian Animal Hospital is highly recommended👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿",

You can play your own music next to it. There are 60cm and 90cm tables that allow beginner and intermediate players to practice many different movements. There is a parking lot at the back, so you don't have to worry about this part whether you have a motorcycle or a car. The floor is quite smooth but not too slippery. There is a little too much mud. This part is a balanced report. Overall, it is highly recommended. It is a skatepark with a very high C/P value. I recommend it to everyone.",
